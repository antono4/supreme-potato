The Inner Narrative
We tell stories to ourselves. We unconsciously become stories that we find acceptable. 
If something is not working, then it could be because of a disligning narative. 
It can be made to work by altering the inner narrative. 
Your conclusions are your own conclusions. They may not be someone else's conclusions.
Likes and dislikes are dependent on the narrative. Context determines them. 
Listen to your inner and create a narrative that is acceptable to it. 
The requires flexibility. In the ego, there is infelxibility.
If narrative has power, one can argue what is right and what is wrong.
What is real and what is imaginary.  
And still, you have a power to influence.
