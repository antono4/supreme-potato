The Idea
We have become human being only through evolution.
The next evolution is going to be conscious. 
99% of the evolutionary trains that human has inherited 
belong to the low consciousness category.
The next state of evolution belong to moving towards higher consciousness.
This is where it becomes difficult. 
Because its totally a new unexplored area.
The concepy of yoga, shiva etc barely only provide you the 
first few steps towards what the novely of higher consciousness
might involve. Rest assured moving towards higher consciousness would
surely make you one of a kind. 
That is where the unimaginable can find manifestation.

The source of higher consciousness is inside me.
And I just have to become more and more of that.
