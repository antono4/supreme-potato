Does God exists? Will my prayers get answered? Let's try to answer that. 
Suppose you pray to a deity. And the maker of this is a poor skinny man in a village. 
He made your deity for you to worship and pray. You pray. You feel perhaps good or at least reliant on that deity.
But the maker of it is still poor. Perhaps he hasn't even recieved the payments of his dieties over which you are garlanding flowers. 
Perhaps his children are not fully nourished. Perhaps the maker of this deity was not in the best of his mind space when making this deity.
Perhaps he was thinking about his neigbors wife. You don't know. 
But you still consider that deity to be pious hoping to of doing things that you can't.
